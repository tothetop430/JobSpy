* We’re a stable, private company that focuses on what is best for our users without the need to grow at all costs. We are focused on building a stable product that brings tangible benefits to our users.
* We believe in solving real problems for our users and providing tools that help healthcare companies grow and better serve their patients.
* You'll have the latitude needed to dive deep into issues, make recommendations on process improvements, and talk with users of PocketDoc to help make informed decisions.

**The nitty gritty:**

* Our frontends are written using React & Typescript, deployed automatically using GitHub actions. Our mobile app is built on React Native (with Typescript) with automated CodePush deployments through GitHub actions.
* Our backend API is written in Go and hosted in AWS. Data is stored in MongoDB and we use Firebase for some real-time data.
